# Decision-Tree-Comparison-GUI
This Python script creates a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to compare the performance of different decision tree algorithms on the Iris dataset.
 The user can select a model from a drop-down menu and train it using the "Train" button. The accuracy of the trained model is displayed in the GUI. The user can also view a visualization of the trained decision tree by clicking on the "Show Graph" button.
# Usage 

To run the script, open a terminal, navigate to the directory where the script is located, and enter the following command:

python app.py
and
python main.py

# Dependencies 

This script requires the following libraries:

Tkinter
ttk
scikit-learn
matplotlib

# Models 

The following decision tree models are available in the drop-down menu:

Decision Tree
Random Forest
AdaBoost
Gradient Boosting
ID3
C4.5
CART

# Dataset 

The Iris dataset is a popular dataset for testing machine learning algorithms. The script uses the scikit-learn library to load the dataset and divide it into training and test sets.
